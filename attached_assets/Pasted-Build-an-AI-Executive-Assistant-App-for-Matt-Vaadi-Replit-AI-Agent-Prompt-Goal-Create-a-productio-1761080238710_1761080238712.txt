Build an AI Executive Assistant App for Matt Vaadi (Replit AI Agent Prompt)
Goal

Create a production-ready, full-stack web app that replaces my Executive Assistant by automating daily briefing, email triage and drafting, smart calendar guardrails, CRM nudges, content workflow, SOP search, and gifting triggers. The app runs on Replit with a Node/Express backend, a React frontend, Google OAuth, and scheduled jobs. It integrates with Google Workspace, Zoho CRM, HighLevel (GHL), Trello, LinkedIn, Apollo, Canva, and USPS.

This app must follow my work style and communication rules, including using Google Chat as the preferred channel and protecting my 8 AM to 4 PM Eastern workday with smart scheduling defaults. It should be proactive, not passive, and should create helpful drafts, briefs, and task suggestions automatically. 【8†source】

Tech Stack

Frontend: React (Vite or Next.js running as a Node server if simpler). Tailwind for UI. Simple, clean, fast.

Backend: Node.js + Express.

DB: Supabase Postgres (or Replit DB if needed, but prefer Supabase).

Auth: Google OAuth 2.0 (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Chat scopes). Token storage in DB with refresh.

LLM: Model switch layer that can call Google Gemini (AI Studio or Vertex), OpenAI, or Anthropic. Default to Gemini for long context and Drive docs. Use ENV flags to choose.

Jobs: node-cron for scheduled tasks. Webhooks for Gmail Watch and Calendar channel watch.

Embeddings and vector search: pgvector on Supabase for SOP and docs search.

Secrets: Replit Secrets for API keys.

Tone and Work Rules

Preferred channel for quick pings: Google Chat. 【8†source】

Be proactive. If the app detects a need, act. Do not wait for instruction. 【8†source】

Acceptance Criteria

Google OAuth flow runs and stores tokens. A test call to Gmail and Calendar works.

Daily Brief endpoint returns real data and renders cleanly in the UI.

Email triage lists recent threads and can generate a draft and send on approval.

Calendar scheduling blocks non-window times and applies buffers.

SOP search returns a useful answer and the correct Loom or Doc link.

CRM snapshot pulls deals from Zoho and GHL and flags stale items.

Google Chat bot sends the Daily Brief and handles at least 3 commands.

Jobs run on schedule and produce artifacts (emails or Chat posts).

Setup Instructions (Agent, please generate code and scripts)

Create React frontend in /app with Tailwind.

Create Express backend in /server.

Add Supabase SDK and migration SQL for data model above.

Add Google OAuth using passport or google-auth-library; request Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Chat scopes.

Implement /brief/today using live Gmail, Calendar, CRM mocks first, then real providers.

Implement Gmail draft with a prompt file and tool wrappers.

Add node-cron jobs for Daily Brief and Weekly Scorecard times above.

Create a minimal Google Chat bot that posts to a space or DM.

Provide a .env.example with all keys and callback URLs.

Provide README with install, run, and test steps.

Notes for the Agent

Keep the UI simple and fast. Prioritize the Morning Brief and Comms.

Abstract provider services so we can swap CRMs or models.

Write unit tests for core helpers (time windows, buffers, email classifiers).

No vendor lock in. The model layer must be pluggable.

Respect privacy. Only store what we need. Do not store raw emails if avoidable. Index with embeddings and IDs.

Stretch Goals (if time allows)

Voice capture that converts a short memo into tasks or replies.

Lightweight mobile view for on-the-go approvals.

Admin page to edit rules for email classification and calendar windows.
